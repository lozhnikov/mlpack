/**
 * The vantage point tree (which is also called the metric tree. Vantage point
 * trees and metric trees were invented independently by Yianilos an Uhlmann) is
 * a kind of the binary space tree. In contrast to BinarySpaceTree, each
 * intermediate node of the vantage point tree contains three children.
 * The first child contains exactly one point (the vantage point). When
 * recursively splitting nodes, the VPTree class selects the vantage point and
 * splits the node according to the distance to this point. Thus, points that
 * are closer to the vantage point form the inner subtree. Other points form the
 * outer subtree. The vantage point is contained in the first (central) node.
 * In such a way, the bound of each inner and outer nodes is a hollow ball and
 * the vantage point is the centroid of the bound.
 *
 * This implementation differs from the original algorithms. Namely, the central
 * node was introduced in order to simplify dual-tree traversers.
 * 
 * For more information, see the following papers.
