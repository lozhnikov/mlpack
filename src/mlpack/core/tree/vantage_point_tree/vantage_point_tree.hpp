/**
 * The vantage point tree (vantage point trees are also called metric trees)
 * is a variant of a binary space tree. In contrast to BinarySpaceTree,
 * each intermediate node of the vantage point tree contains exactly three
 * children. The first child contains only one point (the vantage point).
 * Two other children (inner and outer) may be leaf or intermediate nodes.
 * Thus, the point of the first (central) child is the centroid of its siblings.
 *
 * This particular tree does not allow growth, so you cannot add or delete nodes
 * from it.  If you need to add or delete a node, the better procedure is to
 * rebuild the tree entirely.
 *
 * This tree does take one runtime parameter in the constructor, which is the
 * max leaf size to be used.
 *
 * @tparam MetricType The metric used for tree-building.  The BoundType may
 *     place restrictions on the metrics that can be used.
 * @tparam StatisticType Extra data contained in the node.  See statistic.hpp
 *     for the necessary skeleton interface.
 * @tparam MatType The dataset class.
 * @tparam BoundType The bound used for each node.  Currently only
 *    HollowBallBound is supported.
 * @tparam SplitType The class that partitions the dataset/points at a
 *     particular node into two parts. Its definition decides the way this split
 *     is done.
